I am a Geographer and Data Scientist with a strong background in GIScience, remote sensing, and spatial modeling. [cite_start]Currently, I am expanding my expertise through a specialization in Software Engineering[cite: 5, 7, 14, 107, 109].

[cite_start]Since 2020, I have been working as a Research Assistant at the Institute of Applied Economic Research (Ipea) and have collaborated with UN-Habitat, focusing on using geospatial technologies to address complex socio-environmental challenges in Brazil[cite: 18, 19, 21, 22, 30, 31]. [cite_start]My work involves creating thematic maps, automating workflows with Python and R, and contributing to significant publications like the Atlas of Violence[cite: 25, 28, 29, 167, 172, 175, 180, 183, 185, 189, 191, 194, 196].

My goal is to leverage data to understand and mitigate socio-environmental issues, and I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills in a Ph.D. program or challenging research position.
