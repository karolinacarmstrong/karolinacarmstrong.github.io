I am a Geographer and Data Scientist with a strong background in GIScience, remote sensing, and spatial modeling. Currently, I am expanding my expertise through a specialization in Software Engineering.

Since 2020, I have been working as a Research Assistant at the Institute of Applied Economic Research (Ipea) and have collaborated with UN-Habitat, focusing on using geospatial technologies to address complex socio-environmental challenges in Brazil. My work involves creating thematic maps, automating workflows with Python and R, and contributing to significant publications like the Atlas of Violence.
